   93 - 103  f11.7  Semimajor axis (AU)

  106        i1     Uncertainty parameter, U
                    If this column contains `E' it indicates
                    that the orbital eccentricity was assumed.
                    For one-opposition orbits this column can
                    also contain `D' if a double (or multiple)
                    designation is involved or `F' if an e-assumed
                    double (or multiple) designation is involved.

  108 - 116  a9     Reference
  118 - 122  i5     Number of observations
  124 - 126  i3     Number of oppositions

     For multiple-opposition orbits:
     128 - 131  i4     Year of first observation
     132        a1     '-'
     133 - 136  i4     Year of last observation

     For single-opposition orbits:
     128 - 131  i4     Arc length (days)
     133 - 136  a4     'days'

  143 - 145  a3     Coarse indicator of perturbers
                    (blank if unperturbed one-opposition object)
  147 - 149  a3     Precise indicator of perturbers
                    (blank if unperturbed one-opposition object)
  151 - 160  a10    Computer name

There may sometimes be additional information beyond column 160
as follows:

  162 - 165  z4.4   4-hexdigit flags

                    This information has been updated 22014 July 16, for files
                    created after 18:40 UTC on that day.  Classification of
                    distant-orbit types will resume after we ingest data from
                    an outside collaborator.

                    The bottom 6 bits (bits 0 to 5) are used to encode
                    a value representing the orbit type (other
                    values are undefined):

                     Value
                        1  Atira
                        2  Aten
                        3  Apollo
                        4  Amor
                        5  Object with q < 1.665 AU
                        6  Hungaria
                        7  Phocaea
                        8  Hilda
                        9  Jupiter Trojan
                       10  Distant object

                    Additional information is conveyed by
                    adding in the following bit values:

               Bit  Value
                 6     64  Unused or internal MPC use only
                 7    128  Unused or internal MPC use only
                 8    256  Unused or internal MPC use only
                 9    512  Unused or internal MPC use only
                10   1024  Unused or internal MPC use only
                11   2048  Object is NEO
                12   4096  Object is 1-km (or larger) NEO
                13   8192  1-opposition object seen at
                           earlier opposition
                14  16384  Critical list numbered object
                15  32768  Object is PHA

                    Note that the orbit classification is
                      based on cuts in osculating element
                      space and is not 100% reliable.

                    Note also that certain of the flags
                      are for internal MPC use and are
                      not documented.
